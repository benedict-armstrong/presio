// Controller dashboard card layout: configuration + persistence.
//
// The controller is a tiling window manager (react-mosaic) of cards: current
// slide, next slide, notes, thumbnails, and plugins' tiles. Cards always tile to fill the
// screen, so removing or resizing one makes its neighbours grow rather than
// leaving a hole. The layout is a tree (`MosaicNode`); a card is visible iff it
// appears as a leaf in that tree. This module owns the card catalog, the
// default tree, and the localStorage load/sanitize/save logic so the view
// component only deals with React state.
//
// react-mosaic v7 replaced the binary tree with an n-ary one: a parent is now
// `{ type: "split", direction, children[], splitPercentages[] }` rather than
// `{ direction, first, second, splitPercentage }`, paths are numeric indices
// instead of "first"/"second", and a parent can also be a tabs node. Layouts
// persisted by earlier versions are still in the binary shape, so sanitize()
// converts them on read — see legacy handling there.
