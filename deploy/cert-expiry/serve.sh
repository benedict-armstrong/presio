# busybox httpd runs anything under cgi-bin/ as CGI. The wrapper emits the
# header block; check.sh stays a plain script that is runnable by hand:
#   docker exec presio-cert-expiry /srv/check.sh
cat > /www/cgi-bin/check <<'CGI'
#!/bin/sh
printf 'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n'
exec /srv/check.sh
